# Stela - A language learning applicatio7n
This is the API in Ruby on Rails for Stela, a language learning app in Ruby on Rails, Python and React by [Aidan Lardner](https://www.github.com/ajlardner)

## Development
The files in the .devcontainer folder contain everything needed to get the development version of the app up and running in vscode devcontainers or Github codespaces.

Simply spin up the environment in VSCode using the devcontainer workflow, or on Github using Github codespaces, and you will be good to go to start working on the code.
