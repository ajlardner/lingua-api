## Development
The files in the .devcontainer folder contain everything needed to get the development version of the app up and running in vscode devcontainers or Github codespaces.

Simply spin up the environment in VSCode using the devcontainer workflow, or on Github using Github codespaces, and you will be good to go to start working on the code.
